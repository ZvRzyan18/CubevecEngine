# version 0.0.2
 see update_log.txt
# Todo

• implement triangle collision

• implement convex collision

• implement collision pipeline 

• add broadphase collision stage

• add narrowphase collision stage

• add support for fixed joint

# Future plans
• better SIMD support

• stable 2D simulation

• C++/Rust interface

• 3D support
